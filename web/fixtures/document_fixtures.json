But he was\n   <br/>\n   forgetting one tiny thing\u2014like calls to like.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-2\">\n   [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   <br/>\n   Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n   <br/>\n   Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   <br/>\n   the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-3\">\n<i>\n    Peter Karson was dead. He had been dead for some time now, but\n the dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face,\n trickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop,\n from his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at\n a queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow\n where his eyes had been.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<p id=\"element-4\">\n<i>\n    There was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the\n blood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great\n banks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would\n never come to life again.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<p id=\"element-5\">\n<i>\n    I rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as\n before: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not\n changed, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold\n and alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like\n the machinery, and like Peter.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<p id=\"element-6\">\n<i>\n    It was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what\n Peter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic,\n either. It was just an emptiness\u2014a void that could not be filled by\n eating or drinking.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<p id=\"element-7\">\n<i>\n    It was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise\n than they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for\n reason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<p id=\"element-8\">\n<i>\n    But the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore.\n For the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could\n not solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within\n me, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly\u2014something moved on the skin of my\n cheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<p id=\"element-9\">\n<i>\n    A tear was trickling down my cheek.\n   </i>\n</p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-10\">\n   Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\n satisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\n   <i>\n    Citadel\n   </i>\n   was complete, every\n minutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\n laying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\n glittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\n finished, a living thing.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-11\">\n   Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\n ship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\n In his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\n satellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\n insatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\n laboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\n meteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\n stern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-12\">\n   Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\n atmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\n a laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\n the sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\n ether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-13\">\n   A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\n of the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\n that thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\n as if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\n back.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-14\">\n   There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\n impassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\n face, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\n blood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\n body.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-15\">\n   For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\n eyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\n slowly away and was gone.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-16\">\n   \"Lord!\" he said.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-17\">\n   He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\n somewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\n moment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\n was normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\n world had grown suddenly unreal.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-18\">\n   One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\n from the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\n other part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\n It considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\n decided that this was probable.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-19\">\n   Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\n were shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\n newsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-20\">\n   There were flaring red headlines.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-21\">\n   Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\n of course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\n glad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\n terrible illusion.\n  </p>\n<p class=\"ph1\" id=\"element-22\">\n   INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   <br/>\n   200 DEAD\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-23\">\n   Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  </p>\n<p class=\"ph1\" id=\"element-24\">\n   50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   <br/>\n   PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-25\">\n   He pressed the stud.

The order was made public early this morning by\n R. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-29\">\n   \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\n peoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\n depredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\n London; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\n and in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\n reports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\n have not seen them.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-30\">\n   \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\n we face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n   <i>\n    superior to ourselves in every way\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-31\">\n   \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\n ago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\n in any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\n have treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\n have treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\n attacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\n nor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\n have done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\n driven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\n more intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-32\">\n   \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\n challenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\n are threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\n the Invaders!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-33\">\n   Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\n first time.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-34\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Will\n   </i>\n   we?\" he asked himself softly.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-35\">\n   It was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's\n laboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\n a halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\n mechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\n He mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\n in the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\n far enough to admit him.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-36\">\n   Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\n on her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\n blonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-37\">\n   \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\n Then she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n \"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-38\">\n   He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-39\">\n   She frowned. \"Why, no\u2014Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\n hours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-40\">\n   \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-41\">\n   She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\n you know I haven't one\u2014it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\n there's trouble or not. What\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-42\">\n   \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-43\">\n   \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-44\">\n   \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-45\">\n   She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\n walked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\n papers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\n and pressed the stud.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-46\">\n   A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\n suddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-47\">\n   Lorelei caught her breath.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-48\">\n   It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\n the warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\n transport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\n been dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\n yes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\n disappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\n heartbeat they were gone.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-49\">\n   There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\n defiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\n flesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\n men and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\n joined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\n helpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\n horrible than any cry of agony.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-50\">\n   \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\n strangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\n streets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-51\">\n   Lorelei buried her head on his chest, clutching at him desperately.\n \"Peter!\" she said faintly. \"Why do they broadcast such things?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-52\">\n   \"They have to,\" he told her grimly. \"There will be panics and suicides,\n and they know it; but they have to do it. This isn't like a war, where\n the noncombatants' morale has to be kept up. There aren't going to be\n any noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about\n them, so that he can fight them\u2014and then it may not be enough.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-53\">\n   The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared\n away from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached\n out to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles\n tense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating\n up the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the\n rest.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-54\">\n   \"That's the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-55\">\n   \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-56\">\n   Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ...\n forty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted.\n Then they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone\n through the solid wall, or simply melted away.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-57\">\n   The man and woman clung together, waiting.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-58\">\n   There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and\n other faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man\n screamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty\n gurgle and died, leaving silence again.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-59\">\n   Peter's lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms\n were jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away\n from him and started toward the inner room.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-60\">\n   \"Wait here,\" he mouthed.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-61\">\n   She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don't go in there!\n   <i>\n    Peter!\n   </i>\n   \" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-62\">\n   There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been\n cleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down\n the narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal\n cages, and paused just short of it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-63\">\n   The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the\n distorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his\n range of vision.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-64\">\n   Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,\n Lorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the\n broad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His\n glazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness\n straight ahead of him.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-65\">\n   The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.\n In a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,\n paralyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-66\">\n   The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were\n relaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread\n legs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull\n grew gradually flatter.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-67\">\n   When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless\n puddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-68\">\n   There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond\n fear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said\n in a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-69\">\n   The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,\n but there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-70\">\n   The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-71\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-72\">\n   The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The\n ears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips\n seemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There\n were lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only\n the eyes were alive.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-73\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-74\">\n   \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-75\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-76\">\n   He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first\n time he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,\n swaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled\n slowly....\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-77\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-78\">\n   His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't\u2014Go back!\" The horrible,\n mindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\n His insides writhed to thrust it out.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-79\">\n   She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\n floor.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-80\">\n   The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\n it back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\n fingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\n the room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-81\">\n   Somebody said, \"Doctor!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-82\">\n   He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei\u2014\" but his mouth only\n twitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-83\">\n   He tried again. \"Doctor.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-84\">\n   \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-85\">\n   He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him;\n in a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted\n oddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,\n starched odor.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-86\">\n   \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\n pressed him back into the sheets.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-87\">\n   \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-88\">\n   He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-89\">\n   \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been a\n very sick man.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-90\">\n   Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked\n around him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-91\">\n   \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-92\">\n   The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He\n turned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-93\">\n   Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\n stand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\n milky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-94\">\n   In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\n before he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't\u2014fool me. It's been\n   <i>\n    more\n   </i>\n   \u2014than three\u2014months.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-95\">\n   He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\n kept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\n out of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd\n been in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much\n sooner.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-96\">\n   \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\n \"Seeing that assistant of hers\u2014it was enough to knock anybody out,\n especially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with\n   <i>\n    them\n   </i>\n   for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know\u2014you talked a lot. It's a\n miracle you're alive, and rational.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-97\">\n   \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why\n I haven't been able to see her.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-98\">\n   Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to\n take it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children,\n and a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go,\n as soon as you're well enough to be moved. We started digging in six\n months ago.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-99\">\n   \"But why?\" Peter whispered.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-100\">\n   Arnold's strong jaw knotted. \"We're hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else\n has failed.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-101\">\n   Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went on\n after a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.\n It didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't\n even take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\n when a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\n one time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\n didn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'd\n been annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's still\n smoldering.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-102\">\n   \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-103\">\n   \"Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be\n an impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated\n areas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavate\n enough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the other\n three-quarters will be dead, or worse.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-104\">\n   \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-105\">\n   Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You've got to be. You're part of our\n last hope, you see.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-106\">\n   \"Our last hope?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-107\">\n   \"Yes. You're a scientist.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-108\">\n   \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the\n   <i>\n    Citadel\n   </i>\n   . No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but,\n   <i>\n    maybe\n   </i>\n   , he\n thought,\n   <i>\n    there's a chance\n   </i>\n   ....\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-109\">\n   It wasn't very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It lay\n there in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more than\n five hundred meters in diameter, where the\n   <i>\n    Citadel\n   </i>\n   was to have been a\n thousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving into\n the hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled with\n the latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead,\n there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough to\n last a lifetime.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-110\">\n   It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there was\n one other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solid\n meters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmic\n rays, were gone.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-111\">\n   A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, to\n the left of the airlock\u2014\n   <i>\n    The Avenger\n   </i>\n   . He stepped away now, and joined\n the group a little distance away, silently waiting.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-112\">\n   Lorelei said, \"You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-113\">\n   \"Darling,\" he began wearily.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-114\">\n   \"Don't throw your life away! Give us time\u2014there must be another way.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-115\">\n   \"There's no other way,\" Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as if\n he could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.\n \"Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground,\n but that's only delaying the end.\n   <i>\n    They\n   </i>\n   still come down here, only not\n as many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birth\n rate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures:\n we're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-116\">\n   \"They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're a\n million years too far back even to understand what they are or where\n they came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-117\">\n   She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook her\n slender body. But he went remorselessly on.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-118\">\n   \"Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. They\n make tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes,\n or a dozen ears\u2014or a better brain. Out of those millions of\n possible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. We\n can't fight\n   <i>\n    them\n   </i>\n   , but a superman could. That's our only chance.\n Lorelei\u2014darling\u2014don't you see that?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-119\">\n   She choked, \"But why can't you take me along?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-120\">\n   He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. \"You know why,\" he\n said bitterly. \"Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos;\n they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven of\n staying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful.\n I couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die,\n too. You'd be their murderer.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-121\">\n   Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he no\n longer had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone\n out of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You'll\n come back, Peter.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-122\">\n   He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. A\n line from an old film kept echoing through his head. \"\n   <i>\n    They'll\n   </i>\n   come\n back\u2014but not as\n   <i>\n    boys\n   </i>\n   !\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-123\">\n   We'll come back, but not as men.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-124\">\n   We'll come back, but not as elephants.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-125\">\n   We'll come back, but not as octopi.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-126\">\n   He was trembling violently. He ran the last few steps, stumbled into\n the airlock, and pressed the stud that would seal the door behind him.\n   <i>\n    We'll come back....\n   </i>\n   He heard the massive disk sink home, closing him\n off. Then he sank down on the floor of the airlock and put his head in\n shaking hands.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-127\">\n   After a while he roused himself, closed the inner door of the lock\n behind him, and walked down the long corridor into the control chamber.\n The shining banks of keys were there, waiting for his touch; he slumped\n down before them and listlessly closed the contact of the visiplate.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-128\">\n   He swung its field slowly, scanning for the last time the bare walls\n of the underground chamber, making sure that all the spectators had\n retired out of the way of the blast. Then his clawed fingers poised\n over the keys, hovered a moment, and thrust down.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-129\">\n   Acceleration pressed him deep into his chair. In the visiplate, the\n heavy doors that closed the tunnel above him flashed back, one by one.\n The energy-charged screen flickered off to let him pass, and closed\n smoothly behind him. The last doors, cleverly camouflaged, slipped back\n into place and then dwindled in the distance. It was done.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-130\">\n   He flashed on out, past the moon, past Mars, over the asteroid belt.\n The days merged into weeks, then months, and finally, far out,\n   <i>\n    The\n Avenger\n   </i>\n   curved into an orbit and held it. The great motors died, and\n the silence pressed in about him.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-131\">\n   Already he could feel the invisible rays burning resistlessly through\n his flesh as if it were water, shifting the cells of his body, working\n its slow, monstrous alchemy upon him. Peter waited until the changes\n were unmistakably evident in his skin and hair, and then he smashed all\n the mirrors in the ship.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-132\">\n   The embryos were pulsing with unnatural life, even in the suspended\n animation of their crystal cells. One by one he allowed them to\n mature, and after weeks or years destroyed the monstrosities that came\n from the incubators. Time went by, meaninglessly. He ate when he was\n hungry, slept when his driving purpose let him, and worked unceasingly,\n searching for the million-to-one chance.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-133\">\n   He stared sometimes through changed eyes at the tiny blue star that was\n Earth, wondering if the race he had left behind still burrowed in its\n worm-tunnels, digging deeper and deeper away from the sunlight. But\n after a time he ceased even to wonder.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-134\">\n   And one changeling-child he did not destroy. He fed knowledge to its\n eager brain, and watched it through the swift years, with a dawning\n hope....\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-135\">\n   Peter closed the diary. \"The rest you know, Robert,\" he said.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-136\">\n   \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I was that child. I am the millionth mutation you\n were searching for.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-137\">\n   His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your\n brain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid's. You solve\n instinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours\n of work. You are a superman.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-138\">\n   \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-139\">\n   He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he\n stood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but\n little in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled\n over his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of\n flesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had\n a tiny sixth finger on his left hand.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-140\">\n   He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once\n accidentally drawn one of my talons across his face.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-141\">\n   \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I've waited so\n long\u2014keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from\n you, not telling you, even, about Earth until now\u2014because I had to be\n sure. But now, the waiting is over.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-142\">\n   \"They're still there, I'm sure of it\u2014the people, and the Invaders. You\n can kill the Invaders, Robert.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-143\">\n   He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive\n knowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we\n had a saying: 'Fight fire with fire.' That is the way it will be with\n you. You are completely, coldly logical, just as\n   <i>\n    they\n   </i>\n   are. You can\n understand them, and so you can conquer them.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-144\">\n   I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-145\">\n   He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What\u2014what did\n you say?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-146\">\n   I repeated it patiently.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-147\">\n   \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an\n instant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his\n suffering, but I could recognize it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-148\">\n   \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just\n as the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the\n things which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I\n went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as\n the invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are\n more nearly kin to me than your people.\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-149\">\n   Peter's eyes were dull, his limbs slumped. For a moment I thought that\n the shock had deranged his mind.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-150\">\n   His voice trembled when he said, \"But if I ask you to kill them, and\n not my people?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-151\">\n   \"To do so would be illogical.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-152\">\n   He waved his hands helplessly. \"Gratitude?\" he muttered.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-153\">\n   \"No, you don't understand that, either.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-154\">\n   Then he cried suddenly, \"But I am your friend, Robert!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-155\">\n   \"I do not understand 'friend,'\" I said.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-156\">\n   I did understand \"gratitude,\" a little. It was a reciprocal\n arrangement: I did what Peter wished, so long as I did not actively\n want to do otherwise, because he had done things for me. Very well,\n then we must not go back. It was very simple, but I knew that he could\n not comprehend it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-157\">\n   I tried to explain it to him, however. But he only stared at me, with\n an expression on his face that I had never seen there before, and that,\n somehow, I did not like to see. It was disquieting, and so I hastened\n to the end that I knew was inevitable.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n</html>\n\n        </div>\n        \n    </body>\n    </html>\n    "

Blasphemy would be closer to<br/>it.<br/><br/>            Early that afternoon, the<br/>Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to win the American<br/>Football Conference championship. Linebacker Greg Lloyd, accepting the trophy<br/>in front of a national television audience, responded with enthusiasm. \"Let's<br/>see if we can bring this damn thing back here next year,\" he said, \"along with<br/>the [expletive] Super Bowl.\"<br/><br/>            A few<br/>hours later, Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys offered this spirited defense<br/>of his coach on TV after his team won the National Football Conference title:<br/>\"Nobody deserves it more than Barry Switzer. He took all of this [expletive]<br/>.\"<br/><br/>            Iwatched those episodes, and, incongruous as it may sound,<br/>I thought of Kenneth Tynan. Britain's great postwar drama critic was no fan of<br/>American football, but he was a fan of swearing. Thirty years earlier, almost<br/>to the week, Tynan was interviewed on BBC television in his capacity as<br/>literary director of Britain's National Theater and asked if he would allow the<br/>theater to present a play in which sex took place on stage. \"Certainly,\" he<br/>replied. \"I think there are very few rational people in this world to whom the<br/>word '[expletive]' is particularly diabolical or revolting or totally<br/>forbidden.\"<br/><br/>            It turned out there were a<br/>few more than Tynan thought. Within 24 hours, resolutions had been introduced<br/>in the House of Commons calling for his prosecution on charges of obscenity,<br/>for his removal as a theater official, and for censure of the network for<br/>allowing an obscene word to go out on the airwaves. Tynan escaped punishment,<br/>but he acquired a public reputation for tastelessness that he carried for the<br/>rest his life. To much of ordinary Britain, he became the man who had said<br/>\"[expletive]\" on the BBC.<br/><br/>            Neither<br/>Greg Lloyd nor Michael Irvin was so stigmatized. \"It's live television,\" NBC<br/>Vice President Ed Markey said, rationalizing the outbursts. \"It's an emotional<br/>moment. These things happen.\" Irvin wasn't about to let that stand. \"I knew<br/>exactly what I was saying,\" he insisted later. \"Those of you who can't believe<br/>I said it--believe it.\"<br/><br/>            Swearing isn't the only public act that Western<br/>civilization condones today but didn't 30 years ago. But it is one of the most<br/>interesting. It is everywhere, impossible to avoid or tune out.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>               I am sitting in a meeting at the office, talking with a colleague about a<br/>business circumstance that may possibly go against us. \"In that case, we're<br/>[expletive] ,\" he says. Five years ago, he would have said \"screwed.\" Twenty<br/>years ago, he would have said, \"We're in big trouble.\" Societal tolerance of<br/>profanity requires us to increase our dosage as time goes on.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>               I am walking along a suburban street, trailing a class of pre-schoolers who<br/>are linked to each other by a rope. A pair of teen-agers passes us in the other<br/>direction. By the time they have reached the end of the line of children, they<br/>have tossed off a whole catalog of obscenities I did not even hear until I was<br/>well into adolescence, let alone use in casual conversation on a public street.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>               I am talking to a distinguished professor of public policy about a<br/>foundation grant. I tell her something she wasn't aware of before. In 1965, the<br/>appropriate response was \"no kidding.\" In 1996, you do not say \"no kidding.\" It<br/>is limp and ineffectual. If you are surprised at all, you say what she says:<br/>\"No shit.\"<br/><br/> <br/><br/>            What word is taboo in middle-class America in 1996? There<br/>are a couple of credible candidates: The four-letter word for \"vagina\" remains<br/>off-limits in polite conversation (although that has more to do with feminism<br/>than with profanity), and the slang expression for those who engage in oral sex<br/>with males is not yet acceptable by the standards of office-meeting<br/>etiquette.<br/><br/>            But aside from a few<br/>exceptions, the supply of genuinely offensive language has dwindled almost to<br/>nothing as the 20th century comes to an end; the currency of swearing has been<br/>inflated to the brink of worthlessness. When almost anything can be said in<br/>public, profanity ceases to exist in any meaningful way at all.<br/><br/>            That<br/>most of the forbidden words of the 1950s are no longer forbidden will come as<br/>news to nobody: The steady debasement of the common language is only one of<br/>many social strictures that have loosened from the previous generation to the<br/>current. What is important is that profanity served a variety of<br/>purposes for a long time in Western culture. It does not serve those purposes<br/>any more.<br/><br/>            What purposes? There are a couple of plausible answers. One<br/>of them is emotional release. Robert Graves, who wrote a book in the 1920s<br/>called The Future of Swearing , thought that profanity was the adult<br/>replacement for childhood tears. There comes a point in life, he wrote, when<br/>\"wailing is rightly discouraged, and groans are also considered a signal of<br/>extreme weakness. Silence under suffering is usually impossible.\" So one<br/>reaches back for a word one does not normally use, and utters it without undue<br/>embarrassment or guilt. And one feels better--even stimulated.<br/><br/>            The anthropologist Ashley<br/>Montagu, whose Anatomy of Swearing , published in 1967, is the definitive<br/>modern take on the subject, saw profanity as a safety valve rather than a<br/>stimulant, a verbal substitute for physical aggression. When someone swears,<br/>Montagu wrote, \"potentially noxious energy is converted into a form that<br/>renders it comparatively innocuous.\"<br/><br/>            One<br/>could point out, in arguing against the safety-valve theory, that as America<br/>has grown more profane in the past 30 years, it has also grown more violent,<br/>not less. But this is too simple. It isn't just the supply of dirty words that<br/>matters, it's their emotive power. If they have lost that power through<br/>overuse, it's perfectly plausible to say that their capacity to deter<br/>aggressive behavior has weakened as well.<br/><br/>            But there is something else important to say about<br/>swearing--that it represents the invocation of those ideas a society considers<br/>powerful, awesome, and a little scary.<br/><br/>            I'm not sure there is an<br/>easy way to convey to anybody under 30, for example, the sheer emotive force<br/>that the word \"[expletive]\" possessed in the urban childhood culture of 40<br/>years ago. It was the verbal link to a secret act none of us understood but<br/>that was known to carry enormous consequences in the adult world. It was the<br/>embodiment of both pleasure and danger. It was not a word or an idea to mess<br/>with. When it was used, it was used, as Ashley Montagu said, \"sotto<br/>voce , like a smuggler cautiously making his way across a forbidden<br/>frontier.\"<br/><br/>            In that<br/>culture, the word \"[expletive]\" was not only obscene, it was profane, in the<br/>original sense: It took an important idea in vain. Profanity can be an act of<br/>religious defiance, but it doesn't have to be. The Greeks tempted fate by<br/>invoking the names of their superiors on Mount Olympus; they also swore upon<br/>everyday objects whose properties they respected but did not fully understand.<br/>\"By the Cabbage!\" Socrates is supposed to have said in moments of stress, and<br/>that was for good reason. He believed that cabbage cured hangovers, and as<br/>such, carried sufficient power and mystery to invest any moment with the<br/>requisite emotional charge.<br/><br/>            These days, none of us believes in cabbage in the way<br/>Socrates did, or in the gods in the way most Athenians did. Most Americans tell<br/>poll-takers that they believe in God, but few of them in a way that would make<br/>it impossible to take His name in vain: That requires an Old Testament piety<br/>that disappeared from American middle-class life a long time ago.<br/><br/>            Nor do we believe in sex<br/>any more the way most American children and millions of adults believed in it a<br/>generation ago: as an act of profound mystery and importance that one did not<br/>engage in, or discuss, or even invoke, without a certain amount of excitement<br/>and risk. We have trivialized and routinized sex to the point where it just<br/>doesn't carry the emotional freight it carried in the schoolyards and bedrooms<br/>of the 1950s.<br/><br/>            Many<br/>enlightened people consider this to be a great improvement over a society in<br/>which sex generated not only emotion and power, but fear. For the moment, I<br/>wish to insist only on this one point: When sexuality loses its power to awe,<br/>it loses its power to create genuine swearing. When we convert it into a casual<br/>form of recreation, we shouldn't be surprised to hear linebackers using the<br/>word \"[expletive]\" on national television.<br/><br/>            To profane something, in other words, one must believe in<br/>it. The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents, more than<br/>anything else, the crumbling of belief. There are very few ideas left at this<br/>point that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo against<br/>them.<br/><br/>            The instinctive response<br/>of most educated people to the disappearance of any taboo is to applaud it, but<br/>this is wrong. Healthy societies need a decent supply of verbal taboos and<br/>prohibitions, if only as yardsticks by which ordinary people can measure and<br/>define themselves. By violating these taboos over and over, some succeed in<br/>defining themselves as rebels. Others violate them on special occasions to<br/>derive an emotional release. Forbidden language is one of the ways we remind<br/>children that there are rules to everyday life, and consequences for breaking<br/>them. When we forget this principle, or cease to accept it, it is not just our<br/>language that begins to fray at the edges.<br/><br/>            What do we do about it?<br/>Well, we could pass a law against swearing. Mussolini actually did that. He<br/>decreed that trains and buses, in addition to running on time, had to carry<br/>signs that read \"Non bestemmiare per l'onore d'Italia.\" (\"Do not swear for the<br/>honor of Italy.\") The commuters of Rome reacted to those signs exactly as you<br/>would expect: They cursed them.<br/><br/>            What Mussolini could not<br/>do, I am reasonably sure that American governments of the 1990s cannot do, nor<br/>would I wish it. I merely predict that sometime in the coming generation,<br/>profanity will return in a meaningful way. It served too many purposes for too<br/>many years of American life to disappear on a permanent basis. We need it.<br/><br/>            And so I am reasonably<br/>sure that when my children have children, there will once again be words so<br/>awesome that they cannot be uttered without important consequences. This will<br/>not only represent a new stage of linguistic evolution, it will be a token of<br/>moral revival. What the dirty words will be, God only knows.<br/><br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>\n        </div>\n        \n    </body>\n    </html>\n    "

That was before there was anything very interesting\n to know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north\n and south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east\n of Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about\n all even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never\n so much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the\n general public.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-6\">\n   It was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s\n geologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and\n the Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the\n Pecos as far south as Texas.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-7\">\n   Nor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was\n suggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to\n the eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.\n By the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults\n were in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching\n almost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-8\">\n   It is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the\n connection. The population of the states affected was in places as\n low as five people per square mile! The land was so dry it seemed\n impossible that it could ever be used except for sheep-farming.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-9\">\n   It strikes us today as ironic that from the late '50s there was grave\n concern about the level of the water table throughout the entire area.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-10\">\n   The even more ironic solution to the problem began in the summer of\n 1973. It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry\n Service was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could\n expect. Dense smoke was reported rising above a virtually uninhabited\n area along Black Squirrel Creek, and a plane was sent out for a report.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-11\">\n   The report was\u2014no fire at all. The rising cloud was not smoke, but\n dust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer\n air. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire. The Forestry Service\n had other worries at the moment, and filed the report.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-12\">\n   But after a week had gone by, the town of Edison, a good twenty miles\n away from the slides, was still complaining of the dust. Springs was\n going dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in\n the Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as\n this.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-13\">\n   Newspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front\n page; anything is news in late August. And the geologists became\n interested. Seismologists were reporting unusual activity in the area,\n tremors too severe to be rock slides. Volcanic activity? Specifically,\n a dust volcano? Unusual, they knew, but right on the Kiowa Fault\u2014could\n be.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-14\">\n   Labor Day crowds read the scientific conjectures with late summer\n lassitude. Sunday supplements ran four-color artists' conceptions of\n the possible volcano. \"Only Active Volcano in U. S.?\" demanded the\n headlines, and some papers even left off the question mark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-15\">\n   It may seem odd that the simplest explanation was practically not\n mentioned. Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department\n of the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling\n of the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten\n of the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York\n   <i>\n    Times\n   </i>\n   ). The idea\n was not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you\n couldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-16\">\n   To excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault\n had never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,\n never, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in\n California, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or\n some place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more\n plausible theory.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-17\">\n   Still, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew\n bigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including\n Edison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and\n plane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting\n for their university and government department to approve budgets.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-18\">\n   They found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-19\">\n   They found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the\n most violent and widespread earthquake North America\u2014probably the\n world\u2014has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest\n terms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-20\">\n   Rock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of\n chalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces\n of the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any\n relation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.\n East, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued\n buckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new\n cliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry\n earth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,\n into the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-21\">\n   There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.\n Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and\n rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles\n themselves. \"It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,\" said the\n normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the\n scene of disaster. \"No one here has ever seen anything like it.\" And\n the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-22\">\n   \"Get out while you can,\" Schwartzberg urged the population of the\n affected area. \"When it's over you can come back and pick up the\n pieces.\" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership\n privately wondered if there would be any pieces.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-23\">\n   The Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly\n backing north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,\n there might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo\n Counties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-24\">\n   By 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past\n Cedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.\n Land west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded\n several small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty\n miles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent\n several thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-25\">\n   All mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of\n the danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home\n to wait.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-26\">\n   There wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte\n River, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard\n had been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs\n to add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day\n as the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-27\">\n   As the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome\n life. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,\n down. They danced \"like sand in a sieve\"; dry, they boiled into rubble.\n Telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.\n Virtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the\n President declared a national emergency.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-28\">\n   By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,\n and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.\n Trinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all\n death toll had risen above 1,000.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-29\">\n   Away to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.\n Tremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general\n subsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.\n The western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and\n Oklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-30\">\n   On the actual scene of the disaster (or the\n   <i>\n    scenes\n   </i>\n   ; it is impossible\n to speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying\n confusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as\n the land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the\n surface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-31\">\n   The downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,\n just like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. \"We must remain calm,\"\n declared the Governor of Nebraska. \"We must sit this thing out. Be\n assured that everything possible is being done.\" But what could be\n done, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a\n day?\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-32\">\n   The Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its\n way north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New\n Mexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of\n the Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of\n Paris, Texas, had begun to run backward.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-33\">\n   Soon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly\n churning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across\n farmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new\n cliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to\n sink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no\n floods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself\n with no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water\n and jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now\n streaming east.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-34\">\n   Perhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.\n 193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had\n to be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.\n Nearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced\n with a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were\n jammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd\n eastward.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-35\">\n   All through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,\n Omaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center\n for emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and\n dog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the\n demand for gas, but once inside the \"zone of terror,\" as the newspapers\n now called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the\n wrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted\n by refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked\n by a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and\n State troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to\n be done in an orderly way.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-36\">\n   And still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the\n autumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its\n inexorable descent.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-37\">\n   On 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described\n as a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church\n bell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The\n second phase of the national disaster was beginning.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-38\">\n   The noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its\n wake the earth to the north \"just seemed to collapse on itself like\n a punctured balloon,\" read one newspaper report. \"Like a cake that's\n failed,\" said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block\n   <i>\n    south\n   </i>\n   of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There\n was a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the\n astounding rate of about six feet per hour.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-39\">\n   At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all\n day. \"Not tremors, exactly,\" said the captain of a fishing boat which\n was somehow to ride out the coming flood, \"but like as if the land\n wanted to be somewhere else.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-40\">\n   Everyone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere\n else that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,\n seemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a\n draft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at\n about the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center\n from the U. S. marched on the land.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-41\">\n   From the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River\n in Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,\n Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with\n over two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water\n had swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the\n Louisiana-Mississippi border.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-42\">\n   \"We must keep panic from our minds,\" said the Governor of Alabama in a\n radio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. \"We\n of the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before.\"\n Then, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the\n approach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour\n before the town disappeared forever.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-43\">\n   One head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in\n the hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest\n land. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of\n Louisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-44\">\n   The Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute\n by minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling\n north. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,\n Helena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered\n through the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping\n 2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The \"Memphis Tilt\" is today one of\n the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but\n during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-45\">\n   South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.\n By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves\n advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests\n forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the\n thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-46\">\n   Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the\n wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land\n rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the\n water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,\n deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-47\">\n   Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually\n stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the\n desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the\n land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from\n the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in\n evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to\n North Dakota.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-48\">\n   Lubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted\n out Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one\n great swirl.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-49\">\n   Whirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was\n sucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on\n the cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be\n rescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos\n River afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as\n the water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most\n terrible sound they had ever heard.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-50\">\n   \"We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all\n the noise,\" said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. \"But we knew there\n were people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a\n collision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,\n because of the spray.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-51\">\n<i>\n    Salt spray.\n   </i>\n   The ocean had come to New Mexico.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-52\">\n   The cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward\n march of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and\n tumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of\n granite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,\n Colorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-53\">\n   The water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north\n along the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on\n Sterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.\n The entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its\n eventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the\n new sea.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-54\">\n   Memphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed\n precarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of\n Missouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville\n were the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went\n down with his State.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-55\">\n   Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove\n of the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished\n Nebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on\n radio and television.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-56\">\n   Virtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,\n South Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy\n Creeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn\n on the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the\n younger children and what provisions they could find\u2014\"Mostly a ham\n and about half a ton of vanilla cookies,\" he explained to his eventual\n rescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves\n bore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-57\">\n   \"We must of played cards for four days straight,\" recalled genial\n Mrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television\n spectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can\n ever have been called on to face, she added, \"We sure wondered why\n flushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts\n behind, in the rush!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-58\">\n   But such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means\n typical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north\n under the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,\n into the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what\n had been dusty farmland, cities and towns.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-59\">\n   Some people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions\n just ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of\n western Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest\n along what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was\n estimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-60\">\n   No one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety\n of eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished\n from the heart of the North American continent forever.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-61\">\n   It was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea\n came to America.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-62\">\n   Today, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented\u2014and happily\n unrepeated\u2014disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of\n those weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think\n of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential\n curve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,\n it graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the\n equally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and\n greener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark\n Archipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of\n Dakota.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-63\">\n   What would the United States have become without the 5600-mile\n coastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years\n that any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently\n to permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in\n suspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our\n lifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming\n contribute no small part to the nation's economy.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-64\">\n   Who can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the\n amelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?\n The now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged\n Dakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,\n our second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable\n during the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North\n Carolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,\n is directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-65\">\n   Who today could imagine the United States without the majestic\n sea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches\n of Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the\n water's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the\n afternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks\n with the glistening white beaches?\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-66\">\n   Of course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong\n gains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of\n the world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it\n vied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.\n Now, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from\n the Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.\n And though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of\n shipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of\n river shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon\n the Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-67\">\n   And transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks\n and the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the\n Nebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with\n its numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private\n cars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of\n driving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been\n like, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent\n U. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through\n the giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat\n of Manitoba and crossroad of a nation.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-68\">\n   The political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered\n remnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but\n none of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of\n Kansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,\n but following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining\n population decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted\n in the continuing anomaly of the seven \"fringe States\" represented\n in Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of\n them is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically\n indistinguishable from their neighboring states.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-69\">\n   Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of\n the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be\n considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there\n are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the\n Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real\n estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political\n scene.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-70\">\n   But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile\n when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even\n the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea\u2014fourteen million\n dead, untold property destroyed\u2014really offsets the asset we enjoy\n today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the\n world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade\n and the ferment of world culture.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-71\">\n   It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last\n century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation\n walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen\n miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as\n world ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken\n would be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,\n and the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have\n developed on the new harbors of the inland sea.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-72\">\n   Unimaginable too would have been the general growth of population\n in the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and\n manufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created\n axis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of\n which we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to\n be ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American\n west. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing\n industry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and\n fleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made\n its laborious and dusty way west!\n  </p>\n</html>\n\n        </div>\n        \n    </body>\n    </html>\n    "

LAFFERTY\n  </h2>\n<p id=\"element-2\">\n   [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   <br/>\n   Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961.\n   <br/>\n   Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   <br/>\n   the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-3\">\n   The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there be\n life traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. So\n they skipped several steps in the procedure.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-4\">\n   The chordata discerner read\n   <i>\n    Positive\n   </i>\n   over most of the surface. There\n was spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omitted\n several tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thought\n on the body?\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-5\">\n   Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; it\n required a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they found\n nothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Then\n it came\u2014clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-6\">\n   \"Limited,\" said Steiner, \"as though within a pale. As though there were\n but one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of the\n surface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hours\n before it's back in our ken if we let it go now.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-7\">\n   \"Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest of\n the world to make sure we've missed nothing,\" said Stark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-8\">\n   There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult of\n analysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This was\n designed simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this might\n be so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and the\n designer of it were puzzled as to how to read the results.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-9\">\n   The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locator\n had refused to read\n   <i>\n    Positive\n   </i>\n   when turned on the inventor himself,\n bad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he had\n extraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. He\n told the machine so heatedly.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-10\">\n   The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, that\n Glaser did\n   <i>\n    not\n   </i>\n   have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinary\n perception to an extraordinary degree. There is a\n   <i>\n    difference\n   </i>\n   , the\n machine insisted.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-11\">\n   It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but built\n others more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the owners\n of Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-12\">\n   And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (or\n Eppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read\n   <i>\n    Positive\n   </i>\n   on a\n number of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could not\n even read music. But it had also read\n   <i>\n    Positive\n   </i>\n   on ninety per cent of\n the acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been a\n sound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Mi\n it had read\n   <i>\n    Positive\n   </i>\n   on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out of\n billions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at all\n was shown by the test.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-13\">\n   So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the area\n and got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently one\n individual, though this could not be certain) and got very definite\n action. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, and\n assumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-14\">\n   Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it ever\n produces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrug\n of the shoulders in a man. They called it the \"You tell\n   <i>\n    me\n   </i>\n   light.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-15\">\n   So among the intelligences there was at least one that might be\n extraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to be\n forewarned.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-16\">\n   \"Scan the remainder of the world, Steiner,\" said Stark, \"and the rest\n of us will get some sleep. If you find no other spot then we will go\n down on that one the next time it is in position under us, in about\n twelve hours.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-17\">\n   \"You don't want to visit any of the other areas first? Somewhere away\n from the thoughtful creature?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-18\">\n   \"No. The rest of the world may be dangerous. There must be a reason\n that thought is in one spot only. If we find no others then we will go\n down boldly and visit this.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-19\">\n   So they all, except Steiner, went off to their bunks then: Stark, the\n Captain; Gregory Gilbert, the executive officer; Wolfgang Langweilig,\n the engineer; Casper Craig, super-cargo, tycoon and 51% owner of the\n Little Probe, and F. R. Briton, S.J., a Jesuit priest who was linguist\n and checker champion of the craft.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-20\">\n   Dawn did not come to the moon-town. The Little Probe hovered stationary\n in the light and the moon-town came up under the dawn. Then the Probe\n went down to visit whatever was there.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-21\">\n   \"There's no town,\" said Steiner. \"Not a building. Yet we're on the\n track of the minds. There's nothing but a meadow and some boscage, a\n sort of fountain or pool, and four streams coming out of it.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-22\">\n   \"Keep on towards the minds,\" said Stark. \"They're our target.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-23\">\n   \"Not a building, not two sticks or stones placed together. That looks\n like an Earth-type sheep there. And that looks like an Earth-lion,\n I'm almost afraid to say. And those two ... why, they could well be\n Earth-people. But with a difference. Where is that bright light coming\n from?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-24\">\n   \"I don't know, but they're right in the middle of it. Land here. We'll\n go to meet them at once. Timidity has never been an efficacious tool\n with us.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-25\">\n   Well, they were people. And one could only wish that all people were\n like them. There was a man and a woman, and they were clothed either\n in very bright garments or in no garments at all, but only in a very\n bright light.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-26\">\n   \"Talk to them, Father Briton,\" said Stark. \"You are the linguist.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-27\">\n   \"Howdy,\" said the priest.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-28\">\n   He may or may not have been understood, but the two of them smiled at\n him, so he went on.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-29\">\n   \"Father Briton from Philadelphia,\" he said, \"on detached service. And\n you, my good man, what is your handle, your monicker, your tag?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-30\">\n   \"Ha-Adamah,\" said the man.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-31\">\n   \"And your daughter, or niece?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-32\">\n   It may be that the shining man frowned momentarily at this; but the\n woman smiled, proving that she was human.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-33\">\n   \"The woman is named Hawwah,\" said the man. \"The sheep is named sheep,\n the lion is named lion, the horse is named horse and the hoolock is\n named hoolock.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-34\">\n   \"I understand. It is possible that this could go on and on. How is it\n that you use the English tongue?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-35\">\n   \"I have only one tongue; but it is given to us to be understood by all;\n by the eagle, by the squirrel, by the ass, by the English.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-36\">\n   \"We happen to be bloody Yankees, but we use a borrowed tongue. You\n wouldn't have a drink on you for a tubful of thirsty travellers, would\n you?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-37\">\n   \"The fountain.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-38\">\n   \"Ah\u2014I see.\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-39\">\n   But the crew all drank of the fountain to be sociable. It was water,\n but water that excelled, cool and with all its original bubbles like\n the first water ever made.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-40\">\n   \"What do you make of them?\" asked Stark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-41\">\n   \"Human,\" said Steiner. \"It may even be that they are a little more than\n human. I don't understand that light that surrounds them. And they seem\n to be clothed, as it were, in dignity.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-42\">\n   \"And very little else,\" said Father Briton, \"though that light trick\n does serve a purpose. But I'm not sure they'd pass in Philadelphia.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-43\">\n   \"Talk to them again,\" said Stark. \"You're the linguist.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-44\">\n   \"That isn't necessary here, Captain. Talk to them yourself.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-45\">\n   \"Are there any other people here?\" Stark asked the man.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-46\">\n   \"The two of us. Man and woman.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-47\">\n   \"But are there any others?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-48\">\n   \"How would there be any others? What other kind of people could there\n be than man and woman?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-49\">\n   \"But is there more than one man or woman?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-50\">\n   \"How could there be more than one of anything?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-51\">\n   The captain was a little puzzled by this, but he went on doggedly:\n \"Ha-Adamah, what do you think that we are? Are we not people?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-52\">\n   \"You are not anything till I name you. But I will name you and then\n you can be. You are named Captain. He is named Priest. He is named\n Engineer. He is named Flunky.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-53\">\n   \"Thanks a lot,\" said Steiner.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-54\">\n   \"But are we not people?\" persisted Captain Stark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-55\">\n   \"No. We are the people. There are no people but two. How could there be\n other people?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-56\">\n   \"And the damnest thing about it,\" muttered Langweilig, \"is, how are you\n going to prove him wrong? But it does give you a small feeling.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-57\">\n   \"Can we have something to eat?\" asked the Captain.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-58\">\n   \"Pick from the trees,\" said Ha-Adamah, \"and then it may be that you\n will want to sleep on the grass. Being not of human nature (which does\n not need sleep or rest), it may be that you require respite. But you\n are free to enjoy the garden and its fruits.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-59\">\n   \"We will,\" said Captain Stark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-60\">\n   They wandered about the place, but they were uneasy. There were the\n animals. The lion and lioness were enough to make one cautious, though\n they offered no harm. The two bears had a puzzling look, as though they\n wanted either to frolic with you or to mangle you.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-61\">\n   \"If there are only two people here,\" said Casper Craig, \"then it may be\n that the rest of the world is not dangerous at all. It looked fertile\n wherever we scanned it, though not so fertile as this central bit. And\n those rocks would bear examining.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-62\">\n   \"Flecked with gold, and possibly with something else,\" said Stark. \"A\n very promising site.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-63\">\n   \"And everything grows here,\" added Steiner. \"Those are Earth-fruits and\n I never saw finer. I've tasted the grapes and plums and pears. The figs\n and dates are superb, the quince is as flavorsome as a quince can be,\n the cherries are excellent. And I never did taste such oranges. But I\n haven't yet tried the\u2014\" and he stopped.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-64\">\n   \"If you're thinking what I'm afraid to think,\" said Gilbert, \"then it\n will be the test at least: whether we're having a pleasant dream or\n whether this is reality. Go ahead and eat one.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-65\">\n   \"I won't be the first to eat one. You eat.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-66\">\n   \"Ask him first. You ask him.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-67\">\n   \"Ha-Adamah, is it allowed to eat the apples?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-68\">\n   \"Certainly. Eat. It is the finest fruit in the garden.\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-69\">\n   \"Well, the analogy breaks down there,\" said Stark. \"I was almost\n beginning to believe in the thing. But if it isn't that, then what.\n Father Briton, you are the linguist, but in Hebrew does not Ha-Adamah\n and Hawwah mean\u2014?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-70\">\n   \"Of course they do. You know that as well as I.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-71\">\n   \"I was never a believer. But would it be possible for the exact same\n proposition to maintain here as on Earth?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-72\">\n   \"All things are possible.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-73\">\n   And it was then that Ha-Adamah, the shining man, gave a wild cry: \"No,\n no. Do not approach it. It is not allowed to eat of that one!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-74\">\n   It was the pomegranate tree, and he was warning Langweilig away from it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-75\">\n   \"Once more, Father,\" said Stark, \"you should be the authority; but does\n not the idea that it was the apple that was forbidden go back only to a\n medieval painting?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-76\">\n   \"It does. The name of the fruit is not mentioned in Genesis. In Hebrew\n exegesis, however, the pomegranate is usually indicated.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-77\">\n   \"I thought so. Question the man further, Father. This is too\n incredible.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-78\">\n   \"It is a little odd. Adam, old man, how long have you been here?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-79\">\n   \"Forever less six days is the answer that has been given to me. I never\n did understand the answer, however.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-80\">\n   \"And have you gotten no older in all that time?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-81\">\n   \"I do not understand what 'older' is. I am as I have been from the\n beginning.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-82\">\n   \"And do you think that you will ever die?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-83\">\n   \"To die I do not understand. I am taught that it is a property of\n fallen nature to die, and that does not pertain to me or mine.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-84\">\n   \"And are you completely happy here?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-85\">\n   \"Perfectly happy according to my preternatural state. But I am taught\n that it might be possible to lose that happiness, and then to seek it\n vainly through all the ages. I am taught that sickness and ageing and\n even death could come if this happiness were ever lost. I am taught\n that on at least one other unfortunate world it has actually been lost.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-86\">\n   \"Do you consider yourself a knowledgeable man?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-87\">\n   \"Yes, since I am the only man, and knowledge is natural to man. But I\n am further blessed. I have a preternatural intellect.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-88\">\n   Then Stark cut in once more: \"There must be some one question you could\n ask him, Father. Some way to settle it. I am becoming nearly convinced.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-89\">\n   \"Yes, there is a question that will settle it. Adam, old man, how about\n a game of checkers?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-90\">\n   \"This is hardly the time for clowning,\" said Stark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-91\">\n   \"I'm not clowning, Captain. How about it, Adam? I'll give you choice of\n colors and first move.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-92\">\n   \"No. It would be no contest. I have a preternatural intellect.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-93\">\n   \"Well, I beat a barber who was champion of Germantown. And I beat the\n champion of Morgan County, Tennessee, which is the hottest checker\n center on Earth. I've played against, and beaten, machines. But I\n never played a preternatural mind. Let's just set up the board, Adam,\n and have a go at it.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-94\">\n   \"No. It would be no contest. I would not like to humble you.\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-95\">\n   They were there for three days. They were delighted with the place.\n It was a world with everything, and it seemed to have only two\n inhabitants. They went everywhere except into the big cave.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-96\">\n   \"What is there, Adam?\" asked Captain Stark.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-97\">\n   \"The great serpent lives there. I would not disturb him. He has long\n been cranky because plans he had for us did not materialize. But we\n are taught that should ever evil come to us, which it cannot if we\n persevere, it will come by him.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-98\">\n   They learned no more of the real nature of the sphere in their time\n there. Yet all but one of them were convinced of the reality when they\n left. And they talked of it as they took off.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-99\">\n   \"A crowd would laugh if told of it,\" said Stark, \"but not many would\n laugh if they had actually seen the place, or them. I am not a gullible\n man, but I am convinced of this: that this is a pristine and pure world\n and that ours and all the others we have visited are fallen worlds.\n Here are the prototypes of our first parents before their fall. They\n are garbed in light and innocence, and they have the happiness that\n we have been seeking for centuries. It would be a crime if anyone\n disturbed that happiness.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-100\">\n   \"I too am convinced,\" said Steiner. \"It is Paradise itself, where the\n lion lies down with the lamb, and where the serpent has not prevailed.\n It would be the darkest of crimes if we or others should play the part\n of the serpent, and intrude and spoil.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-101\">\n   \"I am probably the most skeptical man in the world,\" said Casper Craig\n the tycoon, \"but I do believe my eyes. I have been there and seen it.\n It is indeed an unspoiled Paradise; and it would be a crime calling to\n the wide heavens for vengeance for anyone to smirch in any way that\n perfection.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-102\">\n   \"So much for that.

We'll\n have time to overhaul the blasters. We haven't had any well-equipped\n settlers for six weeks. It used to be we'd hardly have time to strip\n and slaughter and stow before there was another batch to take care of.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-105\">\n   \"I think you'd better write me some new lines,\" said Adam. \"I feel like\n a goof saying those same ones to each bunch.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-106\">\n   \"You are a goof, and therefore perfect for the part. I was in show\n business long enough to know never to change a line too soon. I did\n change Adam and Eve to Ha-Adamah and Hawwah, and the apple to the\n pomegranate. People aren't becoming any smarter\u2014but they are becoming\n better researched, and they insist on authenticity.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-107\">\n   \"This is still a perfect come-on here. There is something in human\n nature that cannot resist the idea of a Perfect Paradise. Folks will\n whoop and holler to their neighbors to come in droves to spoil and mar\n it. It isn't greed or the desire for new land so much\u2014though that is\n strong too. Mainly it is the feverish passion to befoul and poison what\n is unspoiled. Fortunately I am sagacious enough to take advantage of\n this trait. And when you start to farm a new world on a shoestring you\n have to acquire your equipment as you can.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-108\">\n   He looked proudly around at the great cave with its mountains and tiers\n of materials, heavy machinery of all sorts, titanic crates of foodstuff\n space-sealed; wheeled, tracked, propped, vaned and jetted vehicles; and\n power packs to run a world.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-109\">\n   He looked at the three dozen space ships stripped and stacked, and at\n the rather large pile of bone-meal in one corner.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-110\">\n   \"We will have to have another lion,\" said Eve. \"Bowser is getting old,\n and Marie-Yvette abuses him and gnaws his toes.

Shurtleff\n  </h2>\n<p class=\"ph1\" id=\"element-1\">\n   Radio is an absolute necessity in modern\n   <br/>\n   organization\u2014and particularly in modern\n   <br/>\n   naval organization. If you could silence all\n   <br/>\n   radio\u2014silence of that sort would be deadly!\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-2\">\n   [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   <br/>\n   Astounding Science-Fiction April 1942.\n   <br/>\n   Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   <br/>\n   the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-3\">\n   The hurried\n   <i>\n    rat-a-tat\n   </i>\n   of knuckles hammered on the cabin door.\n Commander Bob Curtis roused himself from his doze, got up from his\n chair, stretched himself to his full, lanky height and yawned. That\n would be Nelson, his navigating officer. Nelson always knocked that\n way\u2014like a man in an external state of jitters over nothing at all.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-4\">\n   Curtis didn't hurry. It pleased him to let Nelson wait. He moved slowly\n to the door, paused there, and flung a backward glance at the man in\n the cabin with him\u2014Zukor Androka, the elderly Czech scientist, a guest\n of the United States navy, here aboard the cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-5\">\n   The wizened face of the older man was molded in intent lines of\n concentration, as his bushy gray head bent over his drawing board.\n Curtis got a glimpse of the design on which he was working, and his\n lips relaxed in a faint smile.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-6\">\n   Androka had arrived on board the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   the day before she sailed\n from Norfolk. With him came a boatload of scientific apparatus and\n equipment, including a number of things that looked like oxygen tanks,\n which were now stored in the forward hold. Androka had watched over\n his treasures with the jealous care of a mother hen, and spent hours\n daily in the room in the superstructure that had been assigned as his\n laboratory.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-7\">\n   Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky\u2014a scientist\n whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country\n under the domination of the Nazi\n   <i>\n    gestapo\n   </i>\n   . At other times, the man\n seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer\u2014a mad genius!\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-8\">\n   Curtis opened the door and looked out. Rain whipped against his face\n like a stinging wet lash. Overhead, the sky was a storm-racked mass of\n clouds, broken in one spot by a tiny patch of starlit blue.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-9\">\n   His eyes rested inquiringly on the face of the man who stood before\n him. It\n   <i>\n    was\n   </i>\n   Nelson, his shaggy blond brows drawn scowlingly down\n over his pale eyes; his thin face a mass of tense lines; his big hands\n fumbling at the neck of his slicker. Rain was coursing down his white\n cheeks, streaking them with glistening furrows.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-10\">\n   The fellow was a headache to Curtis. He was overfriendly with a\n black-browed bos'n's mate named Joe Bradford\u2014the worst trouble maker\n on board. But there was no question of his ability. He was a good\n navigating officer\u2014dependable, accurate, conscientious. Nevertheless,\n his taut face, restless, searching eyes, and eternally nervous manner\n got Curtis' goat.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-11\">\n   \"Come in, Nelson!\" he said.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-12\">\n   Nelson shouldered his way inside, and stood there in his dripping\n oilskins, blinking his eyes against the yellow light.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-13\">\n   Curtis closed the door and nodded toward the bent form of Zukor\n Androka, with a quizzical grin. \"Old Czech-and-Double-Czech is working\n hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler's teeth and re-establish\n the Czech Republic!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-14\">\n   Nelson had no answering smile, although there had been a great deal\n of good-natured joking aboard the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   ever since the navy\n department had sent the scientist on board the cruiser to carry on his\n experiments.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-15\">\n   \"I'm worried, sir!\" Nelson said. \"I'm not sure about my dead reckoning.\n This storm\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-16\">\n   Curtis threw his arm around Nelson's dripping shoulders. \"Forget it!\n Don't let a little error get you down!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-17\">\n   \"But this storm, sir!\" Nelson avoided Curtis' friendly eyes and slipped\n out from under his arm. \"It's got me worried. Quartering wind of\n undetermined force, variable and gusty. There's a chop to the sea\u2014as\n if from unestimated currents among the islets. No chance to check by\n observation, and now there is a chance\u2014look at me!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-18\">\n   He held out his hands. They were shaking as if he had the chills.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-19\">\n   \"You say there is a chance?\" Curtis asked. \"Stars out?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-20\">\n   \"As if by providence, sir, there's a clear patch. I'm wondering\u2014\" His\n voice trailed off, but his eyes swung toward the gleaming sextant on\n the rack.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-21\">\n   Commander Curtis shrugged good-naturedly and reached for the\n instrument. \"Not that I've lost confidence in you, Nels, but just\n because you asked for it!\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-22\">\n   Curtis donned his slicker and went outside, sextant in hand. In a few\n minutes he returned and handed Nelson a sheet of paper with figures\n underlined heavily.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-23\">\n   \"Here's what I make it,\" the commander told his navigating officer.\n \"Bet you're not off appreciably.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-24\">\n   Nelson stared at the computations with shaking head. Then he mutely\n held up his own.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-25\">\n   Curtis stared, frowned, grabbed his own sheet again. \"Any time I'm\n that far off old Figure-'em Nelson's estimate, I'm checking back,\" he\n declared, frowning at the two papers and hastily rechecking his own\n figures.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-26\">\n   \"Call up to the bridge to stop her,\" he told Nelson. \"We can't afford\n to move in these waters with such a possibility of error!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-27\">\n   Nelson complied, and the throbbing drive of the engines lessened\n at once. Nelson said: \"I've been wondering, sir, if it wouldn't be\n advisable to try getting a radio cross-bearing. With all these rocks\n and islets\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-28\">\n   \"Radio?\" repeated the little Czech, thrusting his face between the\n other two, in his independent fashion that ignored ship's discipline.\n \"You're using your radio?\" He broke into a knowing chuckle, his keen\n old eyes twinkling behind their thick lenses. \"Go ahead and try it. See\n how much you can get! It will be no more than Hitler can get when Zukor\n Androka decrees silence over the German airways! Try it! Try it, I say!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-29\">\n   Bob Curtis stared at him, as if questioning his sanity. Then he\n hastened to the radio room, with Nelson at his heels, and the Czech\n trotting along behind.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-30\">\n   The door burst open as they neared it. A frightened operator came out,\n still wearing his earphones, and stood staring upward incredulously at\n the a\u00ebrial.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-31\">\n   \"Get us a radio cross-bearing for location at once,\" Curtis said\n sharply, for the operator seemed in a daze.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-32\">\n   \"Bearing, sir?\" The man brought his eyes down with difficulty, as if\n still dissatisfied. \"I'm sorry, sir, but the outfit's dead. Went out on\n me about five minutes ago. I was taking the weather report when the set\n conked. I was trying to see if something's wrong.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-33\">\n   The Czech inventor giggled. Curtis gave him another curious look and\n thrust himself into the radio room.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-34\">\n   \"Try again!\" he told the operator. \"See what you can get!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-35\">\n   The radio man leaped to his seat and tried frantically. Again and\n again, he sent off a request for a cross-bearing from shore stations\n that had recently been established to insure safety to naval vessels,\n but there was no answer on any of the bands\u2014not even the blare of a\n high-powered commercial program in the higher reach, nor the chatter of\n ships or amateurs on the shorter.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-36\">\n   \"Dead!\" Androka muttered, with a bitter laugh. \"Yet not dead,\n gentlemen! The set is uninjured. The waves are what have been upset. I\n have shattered them around your ship, just as I can eventually shatter\n them all over Central Europe! For the next two hours, no radio messages\n can enter or leave my zone of radio silence\u2014of refracted radio waves,\n set up by my little station on one of the neighboring islets!\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-37\">\n   There was a long pause, while commander and navigator stared at him.\n Curtis was the first to speak.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-38\">\n   \"Your secrecy might well cost the United States navy one of its best\n light cruisers\u2014and us our lives!\" he said angrily. \"We need that check\n by radio at once! If you're not talking nonsense, call off your dogs\n till we learn just where we are!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-39\">\n   Androka held out his palms helplessly. \"I can do nothing. I have given\n orders to my assistant that he must keep two hours of radio silence! I\n can get no message to him, for our radio is dead!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-40\">\n   As if to mock him, the ship's radio began to answer:\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-41\">\n   \"Station 297 calling U. S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   . Station 297 calling U.\n S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   \u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-42\">\n   \"U. S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   calling Station 297!\" the operator intoned,\n winking at the two officers over Androka's discomfiture, and asked for\n the bearings.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-43\">\n   The answer came back: \"Bearings north east by a quarter east, U. S.\n Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   !\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-44\">\n   Curtis sighed with relief. He saw that Nelson was staring fiercely\n at the radio operator, as the man went on calling: \"U. S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   calling Station 364. U. S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   calling\n Station 364\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-45\">\n   Then the instrument rasped again: \"Station 364 calling U. S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   . Bearings north west by three west. Bearings north west by\n three west, U. S. Cruiser\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   from Cay 364.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-46\">\n   Commander and navigator had both scribbled verifications of the\n numbers. Ignoring the gibbering Androka, who was wailing his\n disappointment that messages had penetrated his veil of silence, they\n raced for the chart room.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<hr class=\"chap\"/>\n<p id=\"element-47\">\n   Quickly the parallels stepped off the bearing from the designated\n points. Light intersecting lines proclaimed a check on their position.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-48\">\n   Curtis frowned and shook his head. Slowly he forced a reluctant grin as\n he stuck out his hand.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-49\">\n   \"Shake, Nels,\" he said. \"It's my turn to eat crow. You and the radio\n must be right. Continue as you were!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-50\">\n   \"I'm relieved, sir, just the same,\" Nelson admitted, \"to have the radio\n bearings. We'd have piled up sure if you'd been right.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-51\">\n   They went on through the night. The starlit gap in the clouds had\n closed. The sky was again a blanket of darkness pouring sheets of rain\n at them.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-52\">\n   Nelson went back to the bridge, and Androka returned to the commander's\n cabin. Curtis lingered in the wireless room with the radio operator.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-53\">\n   \"It's a funny thing,\" the latter said, still dialing and grousing, \"how\n I got that cross-bearing through and can't get another squeak out of\n her. I'm wondering if that old goat really\n   <i>\n    has\n   </i>\n   done something to the\n ether. The set seems O. K.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-54\">\n   He lingered over the apparatus, checking and rechecking. Tubes lighted;\n wires were alive to the touch and set him to shaking his head at the\n tingle they sent through his inquiring fingers.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-55\">\n   Curtis left him at it, and went to rejoin Androka in the cabin. He\n found the little inventor pacing up and down, shaking his fists in the\n air; pausing every now and then to run his bony fingers through his\n tangled mop of gray hair, or to claw nervously at his beard.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-56\">\n   \"You have seen a miracle, commander!\" he shouted at Curtis. \"\n   <i>\n    My\n   </i>\n   miracle! My invention has shattered the ether waves hereabouts\n hopelessly.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-57\">\n   \"Seems to me,\" Curtis said dryly, \"this invention can harm your friends\n as much as your enemies.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-58\">\n   The scientist drew himself up to his full height\u2014which was only a\n little over five feet. His voice grew shrill. \"Wait! Just wait! There\n are other inventions to supplement this one. Put them together, and\n they will defeat the Nazi hordes which have ravaged my country!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-59\">\n   Curtis was a little shocked by the hatred that gleamed in Androka's\n eyes, under their bushy brows. There was something of the wild animal\n in the man's expression, as his lips drew back from his yellowed teeth.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-60\">\n   \"Those tanks you have below,\" Curtis said, \"have they some connection\n with this radio silence?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-61\">\n   A far-away look came into Androka's eyes. He did not seem to hear\n the question. He lowered his voice: \"My daughter is still in Prague.\n So are my sister and her husband, and\n   <i>\n    their\n   </i>\n   two daughters. If the\n   <i>\n    gestapo\n   </i>\n   knew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead. You\n understand\u2014better dead?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-62\">\n   Curtis said: \"I understand.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-63\">\n   \"And if the Nazi agents in America knew of the islet from which my zone\n of silence is projected\u2014\" Androka paused, his head tilted to one side,\n as if he were listening to something\u2014\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-64\">\n   On deck, there was shouting and commotion. Curtis rushed out, pulling\n on his slicker as he went. The shout from the watch forward had been\n picked up, and was being relayed all over the ship. The words struck on\n Curtis' ears with a note of impending tragedy.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-65\">\n   \"Breakers ahead!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-66\">\n   He was beside Navigating Officer Nelson on the bridge, and saw the\n helmsman climbing the rapidly spinning wheel like a monkey as he put it\n hard aport.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-67\">\n   Then the ship struck. Everything movable shot ahead until it brought up\n at the end of a swing or smacked against something solid.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-68\">\n   Curtis felt Nelson's hand grip his shoulder, as he put his lips close\n to his ear and shouted: \"You must have been right, sir, and the radio\n bearings and my reckoning wrong. We've hit that reef a terrific smack.\n I'm afraid we're gored!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-69\">\n   \"Get out the collision mat!\" Curtis ordered. \"We ought to be able to\n keep her up!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-70\">\n   And then he became aware of a deadly stillness. A vast wall of silence\n enveloped the entire cruiser. Looking over the side, he could no longer\n see the waves that a few minutes before had beaten savagely against the\n ship.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-71\">\n   The\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   was shrouded in a huge pall of yellowish-gray mist, and\n more of it was coming up from below\u2014from ventilators and hatchways and\n skylights\u2014as if the whole ship were flooded with some evil vapor.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-72\">\n   Somehow, Curtis' mind flashed to the stories he'd heard of the forts of\n the Maginot Line, and of other forts in Holland and Belgium that had\n fallen before the early Nazi blitzkrieg, when their defenders found\n themselves struck numb and helpless by a gas that had been flooded into\n the inner compartments of their strongholds.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-73\">\n   There were those who said it was the work of sappers who had tunneled\n under the foundations, while others laid the induction of the gas to\n Fifth Column traitors. There were a hundred more or less plausible\n explanations\u2014\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-74\">\n   The vapor clouds that enveloped the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   were becoming thicker.\n All about the deck lay the forms of unconscious seamen, suddenly\n stricken helpless. And then Curtis saw other forms flitting about the\n deck\u2014forms that looked like creatures from another world, but he\n recognized them for what they were\u2014men wearing gas masks.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-75\">\n   Nelson was nowhere in sight. The steersman lay in a limp heap beside\n the swinging wheel. Then a gas-masked figure appeared through the\n shroud of mist and steadied it, so that the cruiser would not be\n completely at the mercy of the wind and the waves.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-76\">\n   Curtis heard the anchor let down, as if by invisible hands, the chain\n screaming and flailing its clanking way through the hawse hole. Then he\n was completely walled in by the yellowish-gray mist. He felt his senses\n swimming.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-77\">\n   Voices droned all around him in mumbling confusion\u2014guttural voices\n that ebbed and flowed in a tide of excited talk. He caught a word of\n English now and then, mixed in with a flood of Teuton phonetics.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-78\">\n   Two words, in particular, registered clearly on his mind. One was\n \"\n   <i>\n    Carethusia\n   </i>\n   \"; the other was \"convoy.\" But gradually his eardrums\n began to throb, as if someone were pounding on them from the inside. He\n couldn't get his breath; a cloud seemed to be mounting within him until\n it swept over his brain\u2014\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-79\">\n   He felt something strike the side of his head, and realized that he had\n fallen in a heap on the bridge. And after that, he wasn't conscious of\n anything\u2014\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-80\">\n   The rain had abated to a foggy drizzle. The wash of the surf swung the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   in a lazy, rolling motion, as she lay with her bow nosing\n into the sandbar at the entrance of the inlet.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-81\">\n   From her bridge, Navigating Officer Nelson watched the gas-masked\n figures moving about the decks, descending companionways\u2014like goblins\n from an ancient fairy tale or a modern horror story. Nelson looked like\n a goblin himself, with his face covered by a respirator. At his side,\n stood his fellow conspirator Bos'n's Mate Joe Bradford, also wearing a\n gas mask.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-82\">\n   Nelson spoke in a low tone, his lips close to Bradford's ear. \"It\n worked, Joe!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-83\">\n   \"Yeah!\" Bradford agreed. \"It worked\u2014fine!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-84\">\n   The limp bodies of the\n   <i>\n    Comerford's\n   </i>\n   crew were being carried to the\n lowered accommodation ladder and transferred into waiting lifeboats.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-85\">\n   Nelson swore under his breath. \"Reckon it'll take a couple of hours\n before the ship's rid of that damn gas!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-86\">\n   Bradford shook his head in disagreement. \"The old geezer claims he's\n got a neutralizing chemical in one of them tanks of his that'll clear\n everything up inside half an hour.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-87\">\n   \"I'd rather get along without Androka, if we could!\" Nelson muttered.\n \"He's nothing but a crackpot!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-88\">\n   \"It was a crackpot who invented the gas we used to break up the\n Maginot Line,\" Bradford reminded him. \"It saved a lot of lives for the\n   <i>\n    Fuehrer\n   </i>\n   \u2014lives that'd have been lost if the forts had to be taken by\n our storm troopers!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-89\">\n   Nelson grunted and turned away. A short, thick-set figure in the\n uniform of a German naval commander had ascended the accommodation\n ladder and was mounting to the bridge. He, too, was equipped with a\n respirator.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-90\">\n   He came up to Nelson, saluted, and held out his hand, introducing\n himself as Herr Kommander Brandt. He began to speak in German, but\n Nelson stopped him.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-91\">\n   \"I don't speak any German,\" he explained. \"I was born and educated in\n the United States\u2014of German parents, who had been ruined in the First\n World War. My mother committed suicide when she learned that we were\n penniless. My father\u2014\" He paused and cleared his throat.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-92\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Ja!\n   </i>\n   Your father?\" the German officer prompted, dropping into\n accented English. \"Your father?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-93\">\n   \"My father dedicated me to a career of revenge\u2014to wipe out his\n wrongs,\" Nelson continued. \"If America hadn't gone into the First\n World War, he wouldn't have lost his business; my mother would still\n be living. When he joined the Nazi party, the way became clear to use\n me\u2014to educate me in a military prep school, then send me to Annapolis,\n for a career in the United States navy\u2014and no one suspected me. No\n one\u2014\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-94\">\n   \"Sometimes,\" Bradford put in, \"I think Curtis suspected you.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-95\">\n   \"Maybe Curtis'll find out his suspicions were justified,\" Nelson said\n bitterly. \"But it won't do Curtis any good\u2014a commander who's lost\n his ship.\" He turned to Brandt. \"You have plenty of men to work the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   ?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-96\">\n   Brandt nodded his square head. \"We have a full crew\u2014two hundred\n men\u2014officers, seamen, mechanics, radio men, technical experts, all\n German naval reservists living in the United States, who've been sent\n here secretly, a few at a time, during the past six weeks!\"\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-97\">\n   The three\u2014Brandt, Nelson and Bradford\u2014stood on the bridge and talked,\n while the efficient stretcher-bearers worked industriously to remove\n the limp bodies of the\n   <i>\n    Comerford's\n   </i>\n   unconscious crew and row them\n ashore.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-98\">\n   And when that task was completed, lifeboats began to come alongside\n with strange-looking radio equipment, and more gas tanks like those\n Androka had brought aboard the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   with him, and dynamos and\n batteries that looked like something out of a scientific nightmare.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-99\">\n   And bustling all over the place, barking excited commands in German,\n pushing and pulling and pointing to emphasize his directions, was the\n strange figure of Professor Zukor Androka!\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-100\">\n   \"The professor's in his glory!\" Nelson remarked to Kommander Brandt.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-101\">\n   \"Funny thing about him,\" Bradford put in, \"is that his inventions work.\n That zone of silence cut us off completely.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-102\">\n   Kommander Brandt nodded. \"Goodt! But you got your message giving your\n bearings\u2014the wrong ones?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-103\">\n   \"Yes,\" Nelson said. \"That came through all right. And won't Curtis have\n a time explaining it!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-104\">\n   \"Hereafter,\" Brandt said solemnly, \"the zone of silence vill be\n projected from the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   ; and ve have another invention of\n Androka's vich vill be even more useful vhen ve come to cut the\n   <i>\n    Carethusia\n   </i>\n   out of her convoy.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-105\">\n   \"The\n   <i>\n    Carethusia\n   </i>\n   ?\" Nelson asked, in a puzzled tone.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-106\">\n   Brandt said: \"She's a freighter in a convoy out of St. Johns\u2014twelve\n thousand tons. The orders are to take her; not sink her.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-107\">\n   \"What's the idea?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-108\">\n   \"Her cargo,\" Brandt explained. \"It iss more precious than rubies. It\n includes a large shipment of boarts.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-109\">\n   \"Boarts?\" Nelson repeated. \"What are they?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-110\">\n   \"Boarts,\" Brandt told him, \"are industrial diamonds\u2014black,\n imperfectly crystallized stones, but far more valuable to us than\n flawless diamonds from Tiffany's on Fift' Avenue. They are needed for\n making machine tools. They come from northern Brazil\u2014and our supply is\n low.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-111\">\n   \"I should think we could get a shipment of these boarts direct from\n Brazil\u2014through the blockade,\" Nelson said, \"without taking the risk of\n capturing a United States navy cruiser.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-112\">\n   \"There are other things Germany needs desperately on board the\n   <i>\n    Carethusia\n   </i>\n   ,\" Brandt explained. \"Vanadium and nickel and hundreds of\n barrels of lard oil for machine-tool lubrication. Our agents have been\n watching the convoys closely for weeks for just such a cargo as the\n   <i>\n    Carethusia\n   </i>\n   is taking over.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-113\">\n   \"Can we trust Androka?\" Nelson asked, with a sudden note of suspicion\n in his voice.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-114\">\n   \"Yes,\" Brandt assured him. \"Of all men\u2014we can trust Androka!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-115\">\n   \"But he's a Czech,\" Nelson argued.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-116\">\n   \"The\n   <i>\n    gestapo\n   </i>\n   takes care of Czechs and Poles and Frenchmen and other\n foreigners whom it chooses as its agents,\" Brandt pointed out. \"Androka\n has a daughter and other relations in Prague. He knows that if anything\n misfires, if there is the slightest suspicion of treachery on his part,\n his daughter and the others will suffer. Androka's loyalty is assured!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-117\">\n   Nelson turned to watch the forward fighting top of the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   .\n The masked German seamen were installing some sort of apparatus\n up there\u2014a strange-looking object that looked something like an\n old-fashioned trench mortar, and which connected with cables to the\n room that served as Androka's laboratory and workshop.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-118\">\n   Another crew was installing radio apparatus in the mizzentop turret.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-119\">\n   Descending a companionway to see what was going on below, Nelson found\n that portholes were being opened, and men were spraying chemical around\n to rid the below-decks atmosphere of the lethal gas that had overcome\n the\n   <i>\n    Comerford's\n   </i>\n   American crew.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-120\">\n   Returning to the bridge, he found that the tide in the inlet had risen\n considerably, and that the cruiser was riding more easily at her anchor.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-121\">\n   Then, at Brandt's orders, the anchor was hauled in, and lifeboats and a\n motor launch were used as tugs to work the vessel entirely free of the\n sand bar. This was accomplished without difficulty.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-122\">\n   Brandt came over to where Nelson was standing on the bridge and held\n out his hand.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-123\">\n   \"Congratulations, Herr Kommander Nelson!\" he said. \"Ve have stolen one\n of the United States navy's newest and fastest cruisers!\" He made a\n gesture as if raising a beer stein to drink a toast. \"\n   <i>\n    Prosit!\n   </i>\n   \" he\n added.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-124\">\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Prosit!\n   </i>\n   \" Nelson repeated, and the two grinned at each other.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n<p id=\"element-125\">\n   Stars were twinkling in a patch of black-blue sky, and broken mountains\n of gray cloud were skudding before the east wind. Commander Bob Curtis\n found himself lying in wet sand, on a beach, somewhere, with the\n rain\u2014now a light, driving mist\u2014beating on his face. He was chilled;\n his limbs were stiff and numb. His nose and throat felt parched inside,\n as if a wave of searing heat had scorched them.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-126\">\n   According to his last calculations, the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   had been cruising\n off the Maine coast. This probably was one of the islets of that\n region, or it might be the mainland.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-127\">\n   It was hard work getting to his feet, and when he did manage to stand,\n he could only plant his heels in the sand and sway to and fro for fully\n a minute, like a child learning to walk.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-128\">\n   All around him in the nearly total darkness, he could make out the dim\n forms of men sprawled on the beach; and of other men moving about,\n exploring. He heard the murmur of voices and saw the glow of lighted\n cigarettes.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-129\">\n   A man with a flashlight was approaching him. Its white glare shone for\n a moment in Curtis' face, and the familiar voice of Ensign Jack Dillon\n spoke: \"Commander Curtis! Are you O. K., sir?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-130\">\n   \"I think so!\" Curtis' heart warmed at the eager expression in Dillon's\n face; at the heartfelt concern in his friendly brown eyes. The young\n ensign was red-headed, impetuous, thoroughly genuine in his emotions.\n \"How about yourself, Jack?\" Curtis added.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-131\">\n   \"A bit of a headache from the gas, but that's all. Any orders, sir?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-132\">\n   Curtis thought for a moment. \"Muster the crew, as best you can. We'll\n try to make a roll call. Is there any sign of the ship?\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-133\">\n   There was a solemn note in Dillon's voice. \"No, sir. She's been worked\n off the sandbar and put to sea!\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-134\">\n   The words struck Curtis with the numbing shock of a blow on some nerve\n center. For the first time, he realized fully the tragedy that had\n swept down on him. He had lost his ship\u2014one of the United States\n navy's fastest and newest small light cruisers\u2014under circumstances\n which smelled strongly of treachery and sabotage.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-135\">\n   As he thought back, he realized that he\n   <i>\n    might\n   </i>\n   have prevented the\n loss, if he had been more alert, more suspicious. For it was clear to\n him now that the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   had been deliberately steered to this\n place; that the men who had seized her had been waiting here for that\n very purpose.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-136\">\n   The pieces of the picture fitted together like a jigsaw\n puzzle\u2014Androka's zone of silence; the bearings given by radio;\n Navigating Officer Nelson's queer conduct. They were all part of a\n carefully laid plan!\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-137\">\n   All the suspicious circumstances surrounding Nelson came flooding into\n Curtis' mind. He had never liked the man; never trusted him. Nelson\n always acted as if he had some secret, something to hide.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-138\">\n   Curtis recalled that Nelson and Androka had long conversations\n together\u2014conversations which they would end abruptly when anyone else\n came within earshot. And Nelson had always been chummy with the worst\n trouble maker in the crew\u2014Bos'n's Mate Bradford.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-139\">\n   Curtis went around, finding the officers, issuing orders. There were\n still some unconscious men to be revived. In a sheltered cove among\n the rocks, an exploring group had found enough dry driftwood to make a\n fire\u2014\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-140\">\n   In another hour, the skies had cleared, and white moonlight flooded\n the scene with a ghostly radiance. The men of the\n   <i>\n    Comerford\n   </i>\n   had\n all regained consciousness and were drying out in front of the big\n driftwood bonfires in the cove.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-141\">\n   Curtis ordered a beacon kept burning on a high promontory. Then he got\n the men lined up, according to their respective classifications, for a\n check-up on the missing.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-142\">\n   When this was completed, it was found that the\n   <i>\n    Comerford's\n   </i>\n   entire\n complement of two hundred and twenty men were present\u2014except\n Navigating Officer Nelson, and Bos'n's Mate Bradford! And Zukor Androka\n was also missing!\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-143\">\n   With the coming of dawn, a little exploration revealed that the\n   <i>\n    Comerford's\n   </i>\n   crew was marooned on an islet, about a square mile in\n area; that they had been put ashore without food or extra clothing or\n equipment of any kind, and that no boats had been left for them.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-144\">\n   One searching party reported finding the remains of what had been a\n radio station on a high promontory on the north shore of the islet.\n Another had found the remains of tents and log cabins, recently\n demolished, in a small, timbered hollow\u2014a well-hidden spot invisible\n from the air, unless one were flying very low; a place where two\n hundred or more men could have camped.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-145\">\n   There was a good water supply\u2014a small creek fed by springs\u2014but\n nothing in the way of food. Evidently food was a precious commodity\n which the recent inhabitants of the islet couldn't afford to leave\n behind.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-146\">\n   Curtis was studying the wreckage of the wireless station, wondering\n if this might have been the source of Androka's zone of silence, when\n Ensign Jack Dillon came up to him.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"element-147\">\n   \"There's a coast-guard cutter heading for the island, sir,\" he\n announced.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"tb\"/>\n</html>\n\n        </div>\n        \n    </body>\n    </html>\n    "
