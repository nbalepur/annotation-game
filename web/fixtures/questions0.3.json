In this play, Henry Tudor, the Earl of Richmond who later becomes King Henry the Seventh, is supported by figures such as his stepfather Lord Stanley, the Earl of Derby, along with the Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Herbert, Sir James Blunt, and Sir William Brandon. It was once thought that the Quarto version represented a separate revision of this play by Shakespeare. Influenced by the \"Tudor Myth\" and emerging theologies of divine intervention and human agency, this play aims to depict Richard as divine retribution for the usurpation of Richard the Second. In this play, Richard is interested in Elizabeth of York and poisons Lady Anne to pursue her freely. For 10 points, name this play that includes the phrase: \"A horse! A horse!
